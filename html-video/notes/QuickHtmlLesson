Teach html - to start don't put <html> stuff

Html is just a bunch of formatted tags

<tag> content </tag> - SHOW picture. element - basic building block of html.  Typically they are made of two tags: opening and closing tag. Sometimes they don't have both. 

<strong> This is going to be a webite about stuff </strong>. It will teach me html. <em>I am going to code </em>.

- notice how there are line breaks in the text but not on the site. in html you have to use a tag called br (breaking line)


self closing tag : <br /> , <hr /> , <img .... /> the only ones of the top of my head. These are special. they are allowed to be like this . They self close with the forward slash 
Known as an empty tag. opening and closing tag in one. 

Another exception to the rule is a comment <!-- comment --> - for the coder to understand the code better. ex. strong tag stands for bold




Header tag : <h1> gets smaller as the number goes down - do all at same time until h4
good for headings on website


Another thing is called nested html tags
ex. <ul> </ul> - by iteself doesn't do too mush. 
li inside ul tag. now it makes it a bit more useful. do ol real quick 




show them actual structur element
SHOW image
<html>…</html>

Every HTML document begins and ends with the <html> tag. This tells the browser that the following document is an html file. Remember, tags tell the browsers how to display information.

<head>…</head>
The <head> tag contains the title of the document along with general information about the file, like the author, copyright, keywords and/or a description of what appears on the page.

<title>…</title>
Appears within the <head> tags and gives the title of the page. Try to make your titles descriptive,

<body>…</body>
The main content of your page is placed within the body tags: your text, images, links, tables and so on

put in html, head, and body tags now. add title tag

Now lets get to attributes
pull up image. lets show an example

<body bgcolor = "lightblue"> boom!
some attributes only work on specif tags and some apply to others (like bg)
	go to cheat sheet
	
if want to change text color
font tag <font color="red"> </font>



insead of colors, starts with pound, called hexv alues


attribute called background - use image insstead of color
 - put in file name for body .



speaking of images
<img src /> self close cause no content

add br tag

lets do a link 
a tag <a href="http:..." target = "_blank"> click me </a>
 
 so can do multiple attributes as long in right format
 
 img can aso have alt = "kitten"
 
 
 oh btw, do another link where its another link on your website. make a new page
 
 
 finally how to create a table
*draw a table on whiteboard* 

you got a table tag here
	2 types of tags. rows are tr, able cells are td. inside of cells are where data goes
	
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>

</table>



cellpadding = "10" maes spaces around words and border bigger
add bgcolor (according to cheatsheet)to table and row and cell
